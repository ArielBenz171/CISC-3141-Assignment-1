### Grading: 
**Project #1 is 20% of your overall course grade. The project itself will be graded out of 100 points. Below is the grade breakdown of the project out of 100 points:**<br/>
1. Project Proposal/Problem Statement: 10% - I will not be assigning what the project theme will be.
It is up to you to present clearly on a single page what your website/webpage is about and the
inspiration behind it.
2. Outline: 20% - Please be clear in your outline. Yes, an outline will not say everything word by
word about your website/webpage, however, it should be readable, understandable, and clear.
Make sure there is a clear and logical flow in your outline.
3. Diagram: 20% - Translate your outline into a diagram (we did a few examples in class). Make
sure there is a logical flow.
4. Code: 50% - Use all tags covered in class and additional tags not covered in class. - Tags covered
in class, excluding the necessary tags (e.g. html, head, body, title) were: p, a, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5,
h6, div, ol, ul, li, br, table, img - For tags: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, you do not have to use all of
them unless you want to - Use additional tags not covered in class - Use inline, internal, and
external css – All three types is a must. Also, please be sure to have good file structure. Keep
your css in a separate file as well as you image(s) in a separate file.

#	Site Description 
Have you ever seen on of those as seen on TV ads that promotes a product which asks a dim-witted and nonsensical problem that the product intends to solve and the product ends up not working at all. (Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoG0vv-twCA) An idea that is a complete and utter scam just to grab as much money as possible. That’s where the idea of my project started, I wanted to create a website that simulated this. After I thought of the idea that we all have as kids, where if we were to dig a whole to the other side of the planet where would we be. This idea is called an antipode and has a decent amount of work and research on it. So, with these two ideas combined I built my site, “The Pit”. 

The site sells you the idea of traveling through a pit from one side of the planet to another. I used a website I found in order to find an antipode to use for the site and I found one between Christchurch, New Zealand and A Coruña, Spain. Then I fleshed out the site to include multiple pages which can be accessed via the navbar. The home page is there to suck you in and buy immediately without knowing what the product even is. The about page actually explains what is going on. The times page shows a table with the location of the antipodes and the times when to jump. Finally, the buy page is a mock purchasing form which leads you to a buy page congratulating you on the purchase. <br/>
