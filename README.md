### Grading: 
**Project #1 is 20% of your overall course grade. The project itself will be graded out of 100 points. Below is the grade breakdown of the project out of 100 points:**<br/>
1. Project Proposal/Problem Statement: 10% - I will not be assigning what the project theme will be.
It is up to you to present clearly on a single page what your website/webpage is about and the
inspiration behind it.
2. Outline: 20% - Please be clear in your outline. Yes, an outline will not say everything word by
word about your website/webpage, however, it should be readable, understandable, and clear.
Make sure there is a clear and logical flow in your outline.
3. Diagram: 20% - Translate your outline into a diagram (we did a few examples in class). Make
sure there is a logical flow.
4. Code: 50% - Use all tags covered in class and additional tags not covered in class. - Tags covered
in class, excluding the necessary tags (e.g. html, head, body, title) were: p, a, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5,
h6, div, ol, ul, li, br, table, img - For tags: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, you do not have to use all of
them unless you want to - Use additional tags not covered in class - Use inline, internal, and
external css ‚Äì All three types is a must. Also, please be sure to have good file structure. Keep
your css in a separate file as well as you image(s) in a separate file.
